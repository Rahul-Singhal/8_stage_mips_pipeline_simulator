CURRENT STAGES:
0: 	stage before any stage(completely abstract)
1: 	IF1
2:	IF2
3:	ID
4:	EX 			: \
5:	MULT 		: - - > these three are parallel(independent). Order between them doesn't matter
6:	DIV 		: /
7:	MEM1
8:	MEM2
9:	MEM3
10:	WB

Because of this the next stage for each instruction at any stage wouldn't just be currentStage++
rather it would depend on the instruction as well as which stage is it in right now
