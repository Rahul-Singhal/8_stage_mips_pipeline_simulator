for stalling arrays, uncomment 
// stallingInstructionId = registers[rsIndex].instructionId;
or other such input register comment
from whereever register stalls are happening

also replace
stallingInstructionId = stages[stageToExecute].instructionId;
with
stallingInstructionId = -1;
where stall due to stage not free is happening


for forwarding arrays

add this line wherever forwarding is happening
registers[rdIndex].forwardIt(id);

and add this line to all WB when its free.
registers[rdIndex].unforwardIt(id);

after that add this kind of clause wherever id is not stalling
if(registers[rsIndex].isForwarded()){
	forwarded = true;
	forwardedFromInstructionId = registers[rsIndex].lastForwarder;
}
if(registers[rtIndex].isForwarded()){
	forwarded = true;
	forwardedFromInstructionId = registers[rtIndex].lastForwarder;
}


check all copy constructors for possible errors
